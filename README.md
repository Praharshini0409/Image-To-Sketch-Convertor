This web application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to upload an image and converts it into a pencil sketch effect directly in the browser — no server needed!
HTML: defines the structure: upload section, preview cards, and buttons.
CSS :styles the layout for a modern, responsive, and clean user interface.
JavaScript handles image processing — it converts the uploaded image to grayscale, applies inversion, blur, and blending techniques to simulate a pencil sketch, and then displays the result along with a download option.
